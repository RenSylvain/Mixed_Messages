## General Information
- The project is decently entertaining. It generates random messages that include a nonsensical joke. It's mainly to test and practice my git and GitHub skills. I built this project to complete a Codecademy module.


## Technologies Used
- Javascript - ES2015
- node.js - v14.18.0
- git - 2.33.0
- GitHub - existing site
- Sublime text - Build 4133
- Terminal - 2.11


## Features
List the ready features here:
- Funny messages


## Setup
I don't know how a person downloads documents from GitHub using terminal yet, so I guess just copy and paste the script.js file into your own script.js file on your computer and type 'node script.js' when your in the respective folder. You'll need to download [node.js] (https://nodejs.org/en/) first.
